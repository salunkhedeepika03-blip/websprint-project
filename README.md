Project Overview

The Campus Event Overview System is a web-based platform designed to provide students with a centralized view of all campus events such as technical events, cultural programs, sports activities, seminars, webinars, and promotional events.

In many colleges, event information is scattered across WhatsApp groups, notice boards, and social media, which leads to missed registrations and confusion. This project solves that problem by offering a single, interactive, and visually appealing website where students can easily:

View all ongoing and upcoming campus events

Filter events based on categories (Technical, Cultural, Sports, etc.)

Search events using keywords (event name, council, or description)

Open detailed event information in a single click

Access registration links directly

The system focuses on excellent UI/UX, ensuring the platform is easy to use, responsive, and engaging for students.
